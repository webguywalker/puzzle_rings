## Puzzle Rings
Programmatically generate olympic rings.

<hr />

### Challenge: We are olympians

**Task:** Someone comes to you and says: I need a program to generate the olympic rings visually. Oh, and make sure you get the dimensions & colour right.

**Demo:** Write a program which will visually generate the olympic rings.

>**SN**: Clearify with that person, what are the exact RGB Values for those rings are and the correct specs because chances are 10/10!!! that after you've generated those rings that person will ask you to change something :)

### Requirements
- PHP5
- Web Sever of your choice

### Getting Started
**1. Clone the Repository**<br />
`git clone https://github.com/webguywalker/puzzle_rings.git && cd ./puzzle_rings`

**2. Run PHP's Built-In Web Server**<br />
`php -S localhost:3434`

 >use any Port if that one is in use
 
 **3. Open url in browser**<br />
`http://localhost:3434`

### Reflection
Was able to complete the challenge in a hour then took the other hour to clean it up visually a bit.
I made it a personal goal to use just PHP and a drawing method of a single pixel. 
**In art**, everyting can be represented by a collection of points in space arranged with a specific algorithm. With some tweaking of those points' attributes/properties anything seen with the naked eye can be replicated.

> So, What's Next

Well, i'm going to branch this off then convert this repo into a tutorial documenting my thought process of attacking this challenge. Most likely before I even make that tutorial i'm going to clean up that code. *It's JANK City right now....Death of Janky Code.*
